In this project, the focus is on analyzing sales trends across various categories of furniture, helping to understand performance in terms of revenue, customer preferences, and potential growth opportunities. The categories could include products such as chairs, tables, sofas, and cabinets, offering a comprehensive view of how each performs in the market.Sales Trends: Analyze total sales over time to identify seasonal trends. For example, chairs may exhibit higher sales during back-to-school seasons or office renovation periods, while sofas may see a spike during holiday seasons when people upgrade their living spaces. This insight allows businesses to plan inventory and promotions accordingly.
Top-Performing Products: Break down sales by product category to identify the most popular types of furniture. If chairs and tables generate the highest revenue, it might suggest a higher demand in office or home-office setups. This can guide product stocking strategies or promotional efforts.
